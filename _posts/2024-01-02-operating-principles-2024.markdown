title:  "Operating Principles 2024"
---
2023 was the year I put my roots down. 
1. I became a US citizen
2. I became a manager
3. I had my second child
There were challenges of course. My wife experienced a tough pregnancy. There were communciation challenges in our relationship. Learnt about emotionally devastasting stuff on personal front (which I won't go into). I fought the fight and won some battles, lost some. In a macro picture, 2023 was a great year and wouldn't want to change much but gave me some important learnings that I wish to carry forward.
