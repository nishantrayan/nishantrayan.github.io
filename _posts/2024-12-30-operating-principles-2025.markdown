title:  "Operating Principles 2025"
---
2024 was a challenging year filled with obstacles. The first few months after my second son's birth were especially difficult, as my wife and I battled health issues amid countless sleepless nights. We hired nannies who helped during weekends, but after realizing they weren't the right fit, we fortunately found someone better. We also made the switch to an electric vehicle, trading in our gas car. While I enjoy driving it, I'm still adjusting to the charging routine.

At work, I became deeply invested in a project idea that I enthusiastically prototyped, only to discover that not everyone shared my vision. Though my team delivered solid work, our final product had some issues we needed to fix afterward. This experience became a valuable lesson in my early management career, teaching me the importance of building trust with my team members.

In the kitchen, I explored my culinary interests, experimenting with available ingredients and following YouTube recipes—mostly South Indian dishes, naturally. I dedicated significant time to supporting my older son at school when he needed extra help. With my wife's guidance, we established a robust support system for him that I believe will prove invaluable. It's reassuring to know that multiple people now care about his wellbeing and success.

Our social life flourished as we strengthened friendships, attending children's birthday parties and hosting my uncles' families. We created wonderful memories exploring different places together, sharing meals, laughter, and joy. I had the unexpected pleasure of reuniting with an old friend I thought I'd never see again, and enjoyed a delightful dinner with college friends.

Next year, I want to focus on a few things:

# Transition and Grow

2025 marks a significant period of transformation and growth in my professional journey. I am committed to expanding my technical expertise by immersing myself in emerging technologies and innovative solutions. Through dedicated learning and practical application, I will build a strong foundation in these new areas. This knowledge acquisition isn't just about staying current - it's about strategically positioning myself to seize new opportunities and tackle more complex challenges in my career. By combining my existing experience with these new capabilities, I aim to make meaningful contributions and achieve significant professional milestones.

# Support Family

Supporting my family is my highest priority. I will focus on helping my older son make a successful transition from pre-school to school. This involves finding the right school that best supports his needs and ensuring his support team remains committed to his growth.

# Time Management

Time management has been a significant challenge for me, particularly at work. My habit of saying yes to every request leads to an overwhelming workload, making it difficult to maintain a strategic, long-term perspective for both myself and my team. To address this, I need to become more selective and decline tasks that don't align with my objectives. The first step is to clearly define my goals and pursue them with determination.

# Physical and Mental Well Being

Physical and mental wellbeing are priorities I pursue through badminton and exercise. In 2024, I established a consistent routine of playing badminton weekly. With my wife's support, I plan to maintain this rhythm in 2025. Additionally, I aim to make regular gym workouts a core part of my schedule.

# Meaningful Social Connections

Meaningful social connections are vital to me. I want to have friends I can lean on during difficult times. While my wife has been an incredible support, I also want to cultivate friendships where I can be vulnerable and seek guidance when needed. Just as importantly, I want to be there for my friends when they face their own challenges. Life's difficulties are universal, but having a strong support network—both giving and receiving help—makes all the difference.

# Conclusion

Like every year, 2025 brings exciting opportunities and possibilities. I look forward to watching my son grow and develop, setting him up for lifelong success. I'm eager to embrace the opportunities to learn and evolve into a seasoned leader. I will continue nurturing meaningful relationships while developing self-reliance through cooking and better time management.
