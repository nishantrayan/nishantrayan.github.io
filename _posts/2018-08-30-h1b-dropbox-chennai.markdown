Dropbox experience
==================
The wait
-------------------
It can be a stressful wait for US non-immigrants who travel back to their home country and choose to get their visa stamped. I empathize with the experience as I have gone through the process twice in the last 2 years. The first time I went through it was more nerve racking simply because I went through it for the first time and the time to hear back from the US consulate in Chennai was longer than what most people in my boat experienced.

Why dropbox?
-------------
The idea the dropbox system is to allow H1B non-immigrants who frequently extend their visas to have a faster turn around time for visa stamping which can be quite critical for some individuals and small companies. It allows you to by pass the interview process all together which can a slightly more involved and strenuous process in itself.

Clarifications
--------------
First I want to clarify a few things that people falsely assume when applying for dropbox based stamping
1. You **DON'T** need get your visa re-stamped if your current visa is valid when you enter the states even if you are with a different employer than the one stamped. All you need is the approved I-797 with new employer along with a valid H1B stamp
2. Its always a good idea to carry the **original I-797** approval notice when you travel internationally. I once had a conversation with a CBP officer who gave me this tip when I showed him a copy.
3. Dropbox **DOEST NOT** need an appointment. You can go to the chosen location at any day (within 3 months after you receive the dropbox waiver confirmation)
4. You can do the dropbox in a country **other than your home country**. The only risk is that if things take time or there is delay you risk being stuck in a foreign country without a valid passport and may also be subject to the visa restrictions for that country. For some folks this risk is acceptable and I have rarely come across folks actually experiencing unreasonable delays.

Process
-------
So you have an upcoming trip to your home country or have an international trip after you expired H1B stamp. Based on your individual preference you can chose to do it in your home country (as part of your trip) or in a different country. Regardless of which location you choose the documents you need to submit are the same and the only impact it might have is on the overall processing time. In a country like India where there are a lot of H1B holders this process may be in the order of weeks but in other countries like Mexico or Canada it might be in the order of days.
Here are the list of things you need
### DS-160
### Dropbox interview waiver confirmation
### Copy of I-797
### Passport size photo
### Passport with all Visa stamps
