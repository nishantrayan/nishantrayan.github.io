## Control 
*  Find the genetic code for control and rewrite it
*  Act your way to new thinking
*  Short, early conversations make efficient work
*  Use “I intend to ___” to turn passive followers into active leaders
*  Resist the urge to provide solutions
*  Eliminate top-down monitoring systems
*  Think out loud (both superiors and subordinates)
*  Embrace the inspectors

## Competence
*  Take deliberate action
*  We learn (everywhere, all the time)
*  Don’t brief, certify
*  Continually and consistently repeat the message
*  Specify goals, not methods

## Clarity 
*  Achieve excellence, don’t just avoid errors
*  Build trust and take care of your people
*  Use your legacy for inspiration
*  Use guiding principles for decision criteria
*  Use immediate recognition to reinforce desired behaviors
*  Begin with the end in mind
*  Encourage a questioning attitude over blind obedience
