This is my 2020 operating principles pledge sheet which includes several improvements I want to make with the way I work and perform. This is solely limited in scope to my professional life although there can be some overlap in application to personal life.

## Leader leader
### Pledge
1. I intend to delegate critical decisions that I don't have to make to people around me. 
2. I intend to treat my direct reports as leaders themselves

### Signs of success
1. The team should function as a cohesive unit even when I am not around
2. Ideas start getting generated from within the team and not just top down


## Learning centric
### Pledge
1. I intend to spend 1 hour every day for active learning
2. I intend to spend 10 minutes every day to self-reflect and come up with actions to improve
3. I intend to revit this pledges document atleast once a week'

### Signs of success
1. I should feel like I am making progress towards my goals
2. My stress levels should improve and feel productive
3. The more I learn the less knowledgeable I should feel and increase my appetite for learning
4. I should complete atleast 1 book a month
5. I should have inclination and mental agility to write my reflections in my blog

## Walk towards goal
### Pledge
1. I intend to look at my goal list and evaluate te plan every week
2. I intend to measure my progress towards the goal every month and take measures if I am off course

### Signs of success
1. I should complete atleast one goal in 6 month
2. I should have a clear plan towards my goals for every month
3. I should know when I am off course

## Digital minimalist
### Pledge
1. I intend to keep my inbox to less than 10 emails 
2. I intend to keep actionable digital notifications to minimum

### Signs of success
1. I should have few notifications that are important and actionable
2. I should be able to respond to emails and notifications on time without any major slips

These operating principle pledges are subject to change. The initial draft of it was written when I had clear mental space as part of my 2020 goal cognition exercise.
