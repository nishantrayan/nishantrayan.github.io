* Pre-heat oven to 350 F (190 C)
* Add the mixture to cake tray after coating it with butter to prevent the cake from sticking
* Set timer for 20 minutes and place the cake tray in pre-heated oven
* After 20 minutes reduce the temperature to 325 F and bake for 10 more minutes
* Finally reduce the temperature to 300 F and bake for 10 more minutes
* Gently poke the cake with a fork or toothpick to check for consistency. If the cake is not fully cooked the fork will dig in easily.
* If the cake is not fully cooked let it bake for 10 more minutes (optional) ONLY if it doesn't appear too burned on the outside
* Once fully cooked remove the cake from the oven and invert it onto a tray. The cake should drop easily onto a flat surface
* If there is dark rim on the cake delicately trim them away
* Slice and serve. Enjoy!
