12. Pre-heat oven to 350 F (190 C)
13. Add the mixture to cake tray after coating it with butter to prevent the cake from sticking
14. Set timer for 20 minutes and place the cake tray in pre-heated oven
15. After 20 minutes reduce the temperature to 325 F and bake for 10 more minutes
16. Finally reduce the temperature to 300 F and bake for 10 more minutes
17. Gently poke the cake with a fork or toothpick to check for consistency. If the cake is not fully cooked the fork will dig in easily.
18. If the cake is not fully cooked let it bake for 10 more minutes (optional) ONLY if it doesn't appear too burned on the outside
19. Once fully cooked remove the cake from the oven and invert it onto a tray. The cake should drop easily onto a flat surface
20. If there is dark rim on the cake delicately trim them away
21. Slice and serve. Enjoy!
