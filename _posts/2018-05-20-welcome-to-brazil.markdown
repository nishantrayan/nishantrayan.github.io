Bem vindo ao Brasil (Welcome to Brazil) 

Day 1
-----
Just landed in Rio De Janeiro. We took a leito Onibus (lazy bus) with reclining seats to Sao Paulo. We stayed the night in the hotel room and ventured out the next day to Av. Paulista. The entire avenue seemed to have been shutdown and only for bikes and pedestrians to roam around. I walked as much as I could and then entered a random cafe. Using my google translate app I managed to order some chicken empanadas (yummmmm) and cappucino (so-so). It was a good easy start to a great trip across Brazil
