Bem vindo ao Brasil (Welcome to Brazil) 

Day 1
-----
Just landed in Rio De Janeiro. We took a leito Onibus (lazy bus) with reclining seats to Sao Paulo. We stayed the night in the hotel room and ventured out the next day to Av. Paulista. The entire avenue seemed to have been shutdown and only for bikes and pedestrians to roam around. I walked as much as I could and then entered a random cafe. Using my google translate app I managed to order some chicken empanadas (yummmmm) and cappucino (so-so). It was a good easy start to a great trip across Brazil.
In the evening I went a mall on Av. Paulisto. Some photos I took along the way

Day 2
-----
We had breakfast in a cafe close to our hotel. We then walked from our hotel to a famous park near by called Ibirapuera. The felt very long even though it was only 20 minutes or so. The weather was a bit hot and I was comfortable in my shorts :) Some photos from the park

Then we headed back to the hotel and a quick freshen up we went to Mercado Municipal (Market) in the heart of Sao Paulo. There we met a really friendly fruit vendor. Thanks to back and forth on google translate on each other's phone we finally understood what he was trying to say to us . He showed us a really great restaurant to have lunch as well. After the lunch we went back to Filipe to buy some fruids from him as we promised. Photos below,

After that we spent some time roaming around the Mercado for a bit. We strolled down one of the busiest streets of Sao Paulo and took a ride back to our now familiar Av. Paulisto (next to our hotel). We strolled down Av. Paulisto in search of a local bar where I can get my [Capirinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha "Caipirinha"). We decided we were not drunk enough and headed to what we thought was a local bar but ended up in a really upscale bar. The ambiance was great and we had some sliders and beer, chatted for a while and headded back to the hotel. 

Day 3
-----
We had breakfast at our hotel and took a ride to join a [free walking tour](https://www.facebook.com/spfreewalkingtour/?ref=br_rs "free walking tour"). The guide was extremely energetic and showed us some of the best art side of Sao Paulo. Some of the amazing grafittis and murals we encountered along the way,

Then we went to a mercado (market) near the Faro Lima bus stand and had some great food. After a sumptous meal we headed to the (Tomie Ohtake)[https://www.institutotomieohtake.org.br/en/tomie_ohtake/interna/exposicoes-individuais-brasil "Tomie Ohtake Institute"] and followed an audio guide on a select collection of art exhibits. After spending about an hour there we went to the Por-do-sol Parque which was recommended to us by our guide as one of the most beautiful places to be in during sunset. We watched the sunset casually set along the skyline of Sao Paulo.

Then we headed to the Shopping mall citade on Av. Paulista and exchanged our USD for Reals and had dinner there before heading to our hotel room. We were tired and felt like we had a very productive day.
