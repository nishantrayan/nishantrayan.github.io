Bem vindo ao Brasil (Welcome to Brazil) 

Day 1
-----
Just landed in Rio De Janeiro. We took a leito Onibus (lazy bus) with reclining seats to Sao Paulo. We stayed the night in the hotel room and ventured out the next day to Av. Paulista. The entire avenue seemed to have been shutdown and only for bikes and pedestrians to roam around. I walked as much as I could and then entered a random cafe. Using my google translate app I managed to order some chicken empanadas (yummmmm) and cappucino (so-so). It was a good easy start to a great trip across Brazil.
In the evening I went a mall on Av. Paulisto. Some photos I took along the way

Day 2
-----
We had breakfast in a cafe close to our hotel. We then walked from our hotel to a famous park near by called Ibirapuera. The felt very long even though it was only 20 minutes or so. The weather was a bit hot and I was comfortable in my shorts :) Some photos from the park

Then we headed back to the hotel and a quick freshen up we went to Mercado Municipal (Market) in the heart of Sao Paulo. There we met a really friendly fruit vendor. Thanks to back and forth on google translate on each other's phone we finally understood what he was trying to say to us . He showed us a really great restaurant to have lunch as well. After the lunch we went back to Filipe to buy some fruids from him as we promised. Photos below,

After that we spent some time roaming around the Mercado for a bit. We strolled down one of the busiest streets of Sao Paulo and took a ride back to our now familiar Av. Paulisto (next to our hotel). We strolled down Av. Paulisto in search of a local bar where I can get my [Capirinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha "Caipirinha"). We decided we were not drunk enough and headed to what we thought was a local bar but ended up in a really upscale bar. The ambiance was great and we had some sliders and beer, chatted for a while and headded back to the hotel.
