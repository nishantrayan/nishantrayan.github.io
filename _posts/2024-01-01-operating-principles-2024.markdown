title:  "Operating Principles 2024"
---
2023 was the year when I established my roots.

1. I became a US citizen.
2. I became a manager.
3. I had my second child.

Of course, there were challenges. My wife experienced a difficult pregnancy, and we faced communication challenges in our relationship. Additionally, I encountered emotionally devastating situations on a personal level (which I won't go into detail about). I fought battles, experiencing both victories and losses. In the grand scheme of things, 2023 was a great year, and I wouldn't want to change much. However, it provided me with valuable learnings that I wish to carry forward.

# Operating Principles

Here are some key operating principles for 2024,

## Seek the truth

Seeking the truth is easier said than done. The abundance of fluff and different perspectives often overshadow actual facts and truths. This year, one of my top priorities will be to cultivate an inquisitive mind that asks the right questions to uncover the truth. Although it may be uncomfortable, it is necessary.

## Learn and grow

In 2023, I had a great guitar teacher who helped me build my guitar skills. This experience gave me confidence that I can learn and improve in any area with determination and perseverance. As I enter the new year, 2024, I am determined to apply this newfound confidence to learn new technologies like AI (which is new to me) and acquire the skills necessary to become an excellent manager. Achieving these goals will require hard work, patience, and dedication.

## Understand perspectives

There are numerous perspectives in the world. Perspectives themselves are neither good nor bad; it is the articulation that determines their quality. After seeking out the truth, distinguishing perspectives from realities should become easier, although it remains a challenging task. Additionally, it is important to respect and comprehend the perspectives of others.

## Family first

This has served me well in 2023. I have always prioritized my family, even when faced with difficult decisions. I have taken time off from work, even when facing deadlines, to support a sick family member when there was no other support available. I will continue to make similar choices and ensure that my family thrives, even if it means my career takes a slight hit. **Having fun in a responsible way is a way to take care of family**

## Build relationships

2023 has been a fantastic year for me to reconnect with old friends and form new connections. I aim to cultivate meaningful relationships with the people who matter most to me, and those whom I can rely on for support. I believe that this is crucial for a fulfilling and enduring life.

# Conclusion

I am very optimistic about 2024. I am going to be building on top of my foundations that I have laid out in 2023 that will support me for a long time and I am super excited.
