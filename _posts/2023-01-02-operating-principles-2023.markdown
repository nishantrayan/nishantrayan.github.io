title:  "Operating Principles 2023"

2022 was a roller coaster year. There were many ups and many downs. Together, they made life a worthwhile experience. Having a >1 year old in the house was hard at times and rewarding at others. Post vaccination, our lives were untied a little bit and we were able to travel within the country and meet family and friends. I was able to pick up badminton again and started to be part of a community of players. I also tried my hand at pickelball for the first time in Dallas, Texas. The weight of responsibilities caused burn out for me which I didn't know I was capable of experience until that point. After that, I decided to focus on myself, read books on meditation and took a course on Shambhavi Mahamudra (offered by Isha foundation). It was a great experience that helped me get back to the state of living a happy life. There were many temptations in my relationship to call on the past and be transactional (given something to ask for return). However, I refrained from them and tried to focus on the problem or need at hand. My wife needed support this year on career and peronsal front and I tried to bethere as much as I could.
I ended the year with 2.5 hour morning routing that I was able to follow 2 weeks straight:
1. 5:30 am - 6:15 am - Exercise
2. 6:15 am - 6:55 am - Read book
3. 6:55 am - 7:15 am - Sit still and reflect
4. 7:15 am to 8 am - Wake up my son and have breakfast together
My son and I have been able to spend quality 1 hour in the morning despite some work heavy days. In addition, it has given a big break for my wife so she can focus on resting and focus on other things.
I could be doing better at communication in relationship. My words failed to carry my intentions at times leading to mis understanding on both sides. Despite best efforts, things fell short and something I wish to get better in 2023. With my transition to management, I had to take a step back from hands on work but still be connected. I am still trying to figure out the right balance for my team. I am still proud of my team and the fact that we were able to grow from a 1 engineer team to a team of 5.

### Moving ahead...
2023
