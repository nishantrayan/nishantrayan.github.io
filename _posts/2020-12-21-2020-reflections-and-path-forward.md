2020 has been a wild year, to say the least. The pandemic hasn't been an easy thing for everyone and I have been extremely blessed to have a loving family and supportive friends without whom it would have been extremely hard.
Every year, sometime in December I look back at my life and think about the things that went well for me and things that I wish I could have done and also plan for the following year. I truely believe in,
```
"If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there."
– Lewis Carroll

"Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it"
― Sara Shepard
```

I always start off with re-evaluating my [principles](https://blog.nishantrayan.com/2019/02/18/principles.html). The key question2 I ask my self are,

1. Has anything changed in the last year that has conflicted or contradicted with my principles. _This usually means my principles are at odds with my reality and it might be time to sunset them_
2. Has anything new that has come up that does not or could not be fit within the outlined principles. _This usually means my principles do not fully encompass my reality and I cannot apply them consistently in my life and it might be time to add new ones_

These questions are important to ask because it is crucial to keep them up to date. If done well, they provide a solid rock to base most of my life. Similar to the foundation of a well built home, principles form the foundation of a well-lived life for me.
