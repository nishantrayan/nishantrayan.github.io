2020 has been a wild year, to say the least. The pandemic hasn't been an easy thing for everyone and I have been extremely blessed to have a loving family and supportive friends without whom it would have been extremely hard.
Every year, sometime in December I look back at my life and think about the things that went well for me and things that I wish I could have done and also plan for the following year. I truely believe in,
```
"If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there."
– Lewis Carroll

"Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it"
― Sara Shepard
```


## How did I do?
I want to start off my reflection process by looking back at some of the key things I have accomplished in the past year - small & large. There are things in there that may seem small but they did make a difference to my sanity or improved me in some ways.
