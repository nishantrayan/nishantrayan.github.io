title:  "Feedback"
---

I just watched two seasons of the tv show Hell's Kitchen. If you haven't watched the show its about a mad chef - `Gordon Ramsay` who is world famous
yelling at many new and upcoming chefs hoping for them to get better for a chance to be a chef in one of his million dollar restaurants.
It got me thinking. Is that the right way to give feedback ? This is a important time in my life for me as I embark on this journey into a leadership role with the responsibility to bring the best in people
I have always defined my mission to be helping people achieve their highest potential to help achieve company's vision for the future.
Feedback is a very important tool and an idea to make that a reality. In this post I hope to explore and share with you my thoughts on feedback giving & receiving and hopefully leave you with few things to think about.

It was 2017. I thought I was doing well in my job. I did acknowledge internally that I had a few areas of improvement. Our team was going through a lot of management changes. In about a year we had over 2 management changes and another one was in the horizon. Also it was perf review time and I remember sitting across my manager to hear him point my ears in his general direction as he delivered her performance feedback for me. I won't go into too much detail but I left that meeting with a fairly deep scar that would change the course of my career for better. Fast forward 2 years, a company change, role change later I look at myself as a striving leader who has a long way to go. 

Now, I don't know if the manager at that time intended it that way but that feedback had a profound impact on my thinking. It made me realize the importance of giving and receiving feedback in a timely manner. Its also extremely crucial for receiver of feedback to have an open mind and heart. You can give feedback to a rock on how unshapely it is but its highly unlikely its going to do anything about. On the other hand if you put water in a bottle it takes the shape of the bottle. You can create a beautiful pathway for it to travel and it will flow the way you direct it. If anything be like water. Listen, understand, act. Thinking of feedback as a way to shape myself to hit new highs has changed me for the best and I still have a lot to learn.


When you are the captain of your team's ship you better be damn good at giving and receiving feedbacks. Many a ships aka teams have sunk because of managers who were arrogant and stonewalled against feedbacks. I have in my career once dodged the bullet of being managed my such a manager. Oh boy, that was a close call. Anyways, what does good feedback skill look like. There were many techniques people have talked and evangelized but end of the day the ultimate goal is to get through to the person receiving feedback that there are things they can do to improve and hopefuly they internalize, analyze and take meaningful action to course correct. Its also equally important to understand the power dynamics to look out for. Sure, you can give regular feedbacks to your peers but if you have't won their respect and/or you are not in the position of power don't expect them to change a ton. At that point your course is clear. You need to build trust first.

As a leader who wants to bring out the best in people possibly the worst thing you can do is not giving feedback in a timely manner and not giving improvement feedback directly. In the book `Radical Candor` Kim Scott talks about how a simple but direct feedback impacted her so profoundly. Sure, there are different techniques like sandwitching a improvement feedback between two postive feedbacks and it has its advantages but I found it to be ineffective as it dilutes the point of the message leaving people with mixed feelings about the conversation and can leave people index more on the positive rather than kindling a sense of urgency to improve. If the intended consequence is to improve people's potential sandwich technique simply doesn't cut it. Then there is SBID

* S - Situation
* B - Behavior
* I - Impact
* D - Discuss

You provide the context (situation) of the feedback, followed by specific behavior or action that they took and the impact it had on people/project or process around them. I also found it to be very effective and important to open it to discussion right after. Its also important to get through S, B, I quickly and clearly. Practicing before delivering your feedback defintely helps. 
There is a critical pre requisite for effective feedback: You and your receiver are on **the same page on the motivation for this feedback**: to improve them. If they don't believe that your feedback is well intentioned be prepared for one of two things: bitter aftermath, inaction.
