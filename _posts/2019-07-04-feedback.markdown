title:  "Feedback"
---

I just watched two seasons of the tv show Hell's Kitchen. If you haven't watched the show its about a mad chef - `Gordon Ramsay` who is world famous
yelling at many new and upcoming chefs hoping for them to get better for a chance to be a chef in one of his million dollar restaurants.
It got me thinking. Is that the right way to give feedback ? This is a important time in my life for me as I embark on this journey into a leadership role with the responsibility to bring the best in people
I have always defined my mission to be helping people achieve their highest potential to help achieve company's vision for the future.
Feedback is a very important tool and an idea to make that a reality. In this post I hope to explore and share with you my thoughts on feedback giving & receiving and hopefully leave you with few things to think about.
