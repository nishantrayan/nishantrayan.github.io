title:  "My principles"

I believe that everyone should have a principle in life. I recently read book `Principles by Ray Dalio`. If you haven't already I promise you that I will be one of the best use of your time. Through this blog I wish to highlight some of the core principles I have set for myself. 

## Healthy living is important

### Exercise everyday

To me its important to have an exercise routine. I used to dance with a team twice and sometimes thrice a week and played badminton for hours at a time over the the weekend. I have a sendentary day job that keeps me strapped to a chair almost all day except when I have to walk between meetings. By having a  dose of active movement I keep myself healthy. 

### Healthy eating

Me and my partner strive to eat good food. On most days we prefer to cook at home and eat a fresh meal which we take pride in. This has not only allowed us to save money but also to feel great about our selves. Our transition from eating out or ordering in everyday to a home cooked meal was not without hurdles. We had to break past the mental barrier of cooking and doing dishes and clearly set that as a priority in our lives.

### Healthy mind

Healthy life is not all about being physically active and eating healtily; having a healthy mind is equally important to me as well. Through meditation I have come to listen and tame my otherwise mischievous monkey brain. I have learnt a lot about myself and developed a sense of healthy self satisfaction by sitting still and focusing on my breathing. Its important now for me to meditate atleast 15 minutes everyday and after I overcame the initial hurdle of self-proclaimed "busy-life syndrome" I have gotten much better at it.
