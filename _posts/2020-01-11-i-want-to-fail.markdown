From the title you probably think I am self deprecating and depressed. I mean why would someone *want to fail*. We all want to succeed and we know that we become what we we think and do. Pondering and actively wanting to fail will only make one a failure in the end.

You are absolutely right in thinking them and I will be sad and will worry about if you didn't. Our society and network imposes success or more clearly, their view of success on every one of us: Nice car, house, family, job and laving lifestyle. They all indicate success to everyone around us. We are also wired to strive and we are never happy when we do get all of them, there is always more we can do and someone of envy we can become.

Failure, on the other hand goes against everything our society wants us to be. I mean who wants to be broke, not have steady relationship, not have a job and live as recluse or whatever else society considers. We all know "failure is the stepping stone to success" but no body wants to step on that stone. We all just want to just cruise hover our way to the top floor. That is a reasonable desire although not a practical one always.

Let me start by saying that I won't consider myself successful by any means. I have few things going well in my life and I do struggle with many things but I am definitely happy with where I am. My journey to where I am is fairly ordinary but not without many road blocks.

Let me talk about failures. I had 3 moments of failures so far in my life and after everyone of them, I felt like I was done, faced mild depression and ultimately turned things around to a state which I consider much better than what I was before it happened.

First one, my failure to pass an exam in college. To give you some context, I grew up in India, a country, where students are pushed their mental limits due to enormouse pressure from family and society and their only  measure of success in life is to get into a great school and job that pays them well. Passion is for the weak. Growing up in a such a competitive environment means a lot of stress to perform well in exams, to get good grades, more specifically, better grades than everyone around me. Up until I was in college I had not failed a single exam. I had not been a rock star in studies, I did well, ranking between second and fifth in class which was really hard in retrospect and I don't give myself enough credits for that. In college, I had cruised through all  the courses with great scores until my last year, where I failed an important course. The professor at the time seemed like a lunatic. When I saw the score on the board, I was surprised, not by the fact that I had failed (which did make me sad) but by a sense of calmness and way I handled it. I thought that given my record of not failing till then and seeing a F on the score board would make me depressed and sad and cry. I did neither of those things. I smiled and told myself: let me fix this. I will give it another shot and prove that I am the best in that course. I worked really hard and took the test again and made it with good grades. This was my first blessing or opportunity. 
In a way, it gave me confidence that I can always snap out of failures. It prepared me for some of the worst times in myself which I at that time I did not know or appreciate enough.
