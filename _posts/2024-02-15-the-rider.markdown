**Who is a Rider? As one may ask**
> 1. Rider is a man on horseback, journeying towards his goal.
> 1. He knows his destination and requires no guidance.
> 1. He leads through actions, using words sparingly to avoid wasting time or attracting opposition.
> 1. He encourages others to join him, but does not wait for them. His vision inspires a sense of urgency in others to ride alongside him.
> 1. He chooses the most efficient route to his goal, considering the difficulty of the journey. If a path proves unfruitful, he is willing to change direction, but he does not hesitate.
> 2. He carefully considers options that are difficult to reverse and takes the time to make informed decisions.
> 1. The rider understands the importance of rest. He is attuned to his bodyâ€™s needs, knowing when to push forward and when to slow down to avoid burnout. He prioritizes tasks to maintain mental clarity, allowing him to stay focused on his goal.
> 1. Surrounded by strong opinions, the rider uses data to support his arguments. In situations where data is scarce, he trusts his instincts and moves forward without burning bridges.
> 1. He acts on his convictions and seeks forgiveness rather than permission. However, he respects authority and adheres to the rules, creating his own when necessary.
> 2. His moral compass is steadfast; he knows he is not above the law.
> 1. The rider empathizes with people but remains focused on his goal. He understands the importance of teamwork and assembles a group of trusted allies to accompany him. His leadership is thoughtful, not authoritative.
> 1. He spends time identifying the correct goal and diligently works to achieve it.
> 2. He thinks in frameworks and principles, allowing him to solve a wide range of problems, not just the immediate ones. Even if it means taking time away from immediate issues, he fights for this approach.
> 1. Though the rider may sometimes feel like a servant seeking guidance, it is only in the pursuit of reaching his destination. He never doubts his direction.
