The burden of unfinished work is real. In a way thats what makes life interesting and tolerable. I consider it like an unfinished painting or a song or a music. You are almost anticipating its end and that makes it interesting.
But what happens when the stakes of finishing them are high: your career, physical well being or others' lives. Does that make it stressful and unbearable ? The stress comes when we are working against a timeline we feel we cannot meet and the
stakes are high. But what happens then? We stop enjoying the journey and cherish how long we have come. We tend to fixate about the deadline and the ticking away of time and start agnizing about the consequences of not finishing them. 
So, we should break the cycle? but how? Consciously making the choice to not stress about the deadline and outcome, planning ahead *to enjoy the journey* and having less of an emotional attachment to the final outcome and focusing on the journey and the joy it brings!
With that we can all be happier!
