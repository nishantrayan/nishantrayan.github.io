The leader I want to be
I have 10 years of experience in my industry. Sometimes I wonder if its a good thing or bad. Good because others perceive me as 
"experienced" and "seasoned". Bad because I worry that my experience biases me towards familiar things. Experience is a double edged sword and I am only starting to wield it.

I have had many leaders in my professional life and they all had a different style and approach to leadership. Some styles resonated directly with me and some didn't. Over a period of time
I have come to develop a sense of radar to identify a leader that had a great rhythm with me. There was only one problem which I soon discovered as an important dimension to a great workplace for me - ME
I changed; with every year, with ever project, I changed. I learnt and got better at certain skill set and sucked at others. A leader who worked well for me at a certain point in my career quickly would quickly became an impedence in others.
As my experience in the industry grew I began to see leadership's approach towards me change.
