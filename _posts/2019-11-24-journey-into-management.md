title:  "My personal journey into management"
toc: true

This year I took a leap. A leap that always terrified me. The journey that every manager who has ever managed me directly has taken. It was time for me to be in their shoes. Throughout my career I have had many managers in 4 different companies so far. Some inspired me, some terrified me, and some just played it safe. There were leaders outside of my direct managers I admired and it was time! I had a path cut out for me. Time to taste from the same goblet. Will it be poison or elixir? Only time will tell but there are some tell tell signs. This article should read out the journey I took in the last 6 months! 

## The Fear
I have been an engineer since I graduated in 2008. Well its over 11 years ago. But I was an engineer before then (I just didn't have a degree). I spent a lot of time at my local CSC computer center to print pyramid of stars. Anyone who was learning to code in the early 2000s know exactly what I am talking about. Flow charts were my cup of tea. I loved expressing complex solutions using simple logical constructs.

Enough of ancient times. I have worked for multiple tech companies so far contributing code, ideas and having constructive arguments with several co-workers. There were definitly times where I felt like sh* when I made production impacting bugs. Bugs that have caused entire company to come to a halt and NO, I did not get fired for that, at-least not until a later point in my career.

Throughout my journey in the tech industry there was one thing that has always been a constant. My fear of being a manager. I feared it not because it was difficult, I feared it because it required programming human interactions and humans don't follow 0s and 1s. There are many was people react and they don't always follow your script. You can't spend the night coming up with a great solution and type feverishly into someone's brain. This uncertainty meant all that I have learnt in my last 10 years was no longer applicable in my job and it almost felt like starting from scratch.
  
## The Struggle
I have always wanted to grow as an engineer. I love speaking the language of technology. This helped me take on more and more complex problems and solve them. As the scope of the engineering problems I was handling increased in size and complexity it was clear that I wasn't going to scale. Of course, I had all the time to work on such projects but for real success, even if I put in 24x7 of my time into it there was still so much that needed to be done with tough deadline. I had to scale, for the success of my projects & the company. I started gravitating towards more planning side of the projects. I figured that if I made a plan of execution to the most detailed level and tell my fellow co-workers who were freed up by their bosses to work with me on the project, they would just follow instructions and be a multiplier of me. It would be as if there were more than one of me.
Except, I was wrong. Humans don't scale like machines. Yeah, its an obvious predicament. My fellow team mates had minds of their own, they listened to their own experience and they acted according to their principles and vision. Now, that was a problem! Now suddenly there weren't (me * N) engineers. There were me, X1, X2, X3, X4 etc.. where Xi was their own unique engineer with their own unique ways. No matter how detailed I layed out a plan of action for the project based on how I would do it with daily planned out task, things would slip, change, get rejected or never completed.

## The Growth
There were few things I learnt through my struggle to become a better engineer working on large and complex problems with multiple engineers (who were not me!). They became my principles for effective leadership
### Always convey The Why
### Seek to understand first
### Provide actionable feedback at the right moment
### Decide early with best data available
### Set expectations and hold accountable
### Balance between acting and being
### Make other's time worthwhile
### In the end, what matters are results

I started leading large and complex projects with these principles. Sure, there were failures, and there were moments that pulled me emotionally to the bottom. Every struggle I had helped me become a better engineer and an effective tech lead. 
Tech lead on multiple projects.
